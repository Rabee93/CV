## About Me 🕵️‍

A recent Makers academy graduate who's driven by learning new technologies and solving problems, comfortable following TDD using Javascript and Ruby. Since graduating i’ve been creating new projects and continuing to learn new technologies that I would like to utilise as a professional software developer. 
My style of work consists of understanding the acceptance criteria by breaking down and understanding the requirements of the project using tools such as trello-board and google diagram to reach consensus with the team. I’m motivated by creating websites and apps that can solve problems and make life easier for people.

## Strengths 💪

- Imaginative and forward-thinking, do not mind venturing into unknown territory and enthusiastic about change and innovation. i'm good at coming up with new ideas, and using my creativity to solve complex problems debugging. 

- Great at cooperating with others and look for compromise when I can, but I'm careful not to sacrifice success and advancement. i'm able to get along with other people and function well in a team.

- Good at balancing structure and flexibility: I know how to plan ahead and set goals in a project, while still being open to opportunities that arise in the moment. Although I like to stay organised and on-track when possible, I'm comfortable with a certain level of uncertainty and are ready to adapt when circumstances change.

 - Good at coping with the stress levels of a typical job and are unlikely to become anxious, depressed, or upset due to the demands of my work. Generally resilient and able to bounce back from stressful situations.

 - Excellent at motivating myself and working on my own. Independent and self-contained, and able to work for long stretches by myself. I spend plenty of time reflecting and analysing, and take a thoughtful, serious approach to my work.
