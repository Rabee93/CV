## About Me

A recent Makers academy graduate who's driven by learning new technologies and solving problems, comfortable following TDD using Javascript and Ruby. Since graduating i‚Äôve been creating new projects and continuing to learn new technologies that I would like to utilise as a professional software developer. 
My style of work consists of understanding the acceptance criteria by breaking down and understanding the requirements of the project using tools such as trello-board and google diagram to reach consensus with the team. I‚Äôm motivated by creating websites and apps that can solve problems and make life easier to people.

- Good at balancing structure and flexibility: I know how to plan ahead and set goals, while still being open to opportunities that arise in the moment. Although I like to stay organised and on-track when possible, I'm comfortable with a certain level of uncertainty and are ready to adapt when circumstances change.
